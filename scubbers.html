        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>The project was conducted in 3 phases. I initially focused on understanding the existing solutions and the market opportunity. Being myself a professional diver, I already had a good idea of the needs of divers, and therefore I could
          quickly come up with a clear problem statement and a MVP scope. Based on that, I defined the main user flows, wireframes, and visual direction. I ended up with a prototype I could validate with other scuba divers successfully.</p>

        <h3>Diving enthusiasts</h3>
        <p>This application targets what is commonly called in the industry “recreational divers”. Amateurs (as opposed to professional divers), with a diving certificate, who go underwater and want to keep track of their scuba history. They are from
          various countries and age ranges.</p>

        </picture>
        <h3>User flow diagram</h3>
        <p>Building a user flow diagram helped me to define the structure of the application that would be supporting the various jobs to be done. From there, I started to sketch the main interfaces on paper, which I then turned into digital
          wireframes with Figma. During that design process, I iterated continuously to fine-tune my original ideas.</p>

        </picture>
        <h3>Style guide</h3>
        <p>I defined a visual direction for Scubbers so I could go from wireframes to high fidelity screens. I first constructed a mood board to gather my inspiration in one place. It helped me to come up with a color palette aligned with the
          emotions I wanted to convey (weightless, peaceful, grateful). I explored various typographies and chose “Poppins” for its friendly aspect; It complements nicely the colors selected. In parallel, I also curated a consistent set of icons, and
          designed custom profile one to bring a scuba touch to the pack.</p>

        </picture>
        <h3>Dark mode by default</h3>
        <p>When diving underwater, you get a feeling of exploring another world, with unfamiliar creatures, shapes, and colors. As you drift in the water, you feel weightless and discover what most people will never experience in their life. You feel
          privileged. Traveling into space is probably the closest adventure to that. So it was natural to opt for a dark mode by default, making the user feel immersed in this environment when using the application.</p>

        </picture>
        <h3>Interface design</h3>
        <p>I applied the style guide defined previously to the wireframes in order to get to the final interfaces. While doing this process, I also iterated on the style guide itself, and the overall experience. Final interfaces are designed for iOS
          as well as Android, with notable differences regarding native navigation patterns.</p>

        <h3>Prototype & Testing</h3>
        <p>I built interactive prototypes for <a

          asked 10 scuba divers to complete 4 established scenarios. The results were very positive as they could all perform the tasks suggested in a successful way! I also gathered some feedback through this exercise which I used to fine-tune some
          minor details on the interfaces.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After 1.5 month of hard work, I was proud of the application I designed. “Scubbers” really meets the goals set at the beginning of the project, and stands out versus the existing solutions available on the market. Through this process, I
          could also learn a lot about native mobile design, and reinforce my UX and UI skills.</p>
